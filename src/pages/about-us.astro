        <p class='text-xl text-gray-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto'>
          Our church adheres to these fundamental Christian beliefs
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class='max-w-4xl mx-auto prose prose-lg'>
        <h3>The Bible</h3>
        <p>
          We believe the Bible is God's Word, inspired by the Holy Spirit,
          without error in the original manuscripts, and the final authority for
          all Christian faith and life.
        </p>

        <h3>God</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in one God who exists eternally in three persons: Father,
          Son, and Holy Spirit. Each person is fully God, yet there is one God.
        </p>

        <h3>Jesus Christ</h3>
        <p>
          We believe Jesus Christ is fully God and fully human. He was born of a
          virgin, lived a sinless life, died on the cross as the substitute for
          sinners, rose bodily from the grave, and ascended to heaven where He
          now serves as our High Priest and Advocate.
        </p>

        <h3>Holy Spirit</h3>
        <p>
          We believe the Holy Spirit convicts the world of sin, regenerates
          believers, indwells them, and empowers them for godly living and
          service.
        </p>

        <h3>Salvation</h3>
        <p>
          We believe salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ
          alone. Good works are the necessary fruit of true faith but are not
          the basis of our right standing before God.
        </p>

        <h3>The Church</h3>
        <p>
          We believe the church is the body of Christ, consisting of all true
          believers. Its mission is to worship God, build up believers in their
          faith, and share the gospel with the world.
        </p>

        <h3>The Future</h3>
        <p>
          We believe in the personal, visible return of Jesus Christ, the
          resurrection of the dead, the final judgment, and the eternal state of
          blessing for the righteous and punishment for the unrighteous.
